HTML Introduction
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph of text!</p>
</body>

</html>
HTML Attributes
HTML Attributes are special words used within the opening tag of an HTML element. They provide additional information about HTML elements. HTML attributes are used to configure and adjust the element’s behavior, appearance, or functionality in a variety of ways.

Each attribute has a name and a value, formatted as name=”value”. Attributes tell the browser how to render the element or how it should behave during user interactions.
<tagname attribute_name = “attribute_value”> content… </tagname>
