Day-1
HTML Introduction
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph of text!</p>
</body>

</html>
HTML Attributes
HTML Attributes are special words used within the opening tag of an HTML element. They provide additional information about HTML elements. HTML attributes are used to configure and adjust the element’s behavior, appearance, or functionality in a variety of ways.

Each attribute has a name and a value, formatted as name=”value”. Attributes tell the browser how to render the element or how it should behave during user interactions.
<tagname attribute_name = “attribute_value”> content… </tagname>
Day-2
HTML Comments
HTML Comments are text in an HTML document that is not displayed by the browser. They allow you to leave notes and explanations directly in the code, which can be especially helpful during the development process or when you need to make future updates.
example
<!-- This is a comment and will not be displayed on the webpage -->
HTML Headings
HTML Headings are used to define the content hierarchy and structure of a webpage. They range from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the most important heading and <h6> the least important. Proper use of headings helps improve readability, SEO, and accessibility.
Syntax of HTML Headings:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
    <h3>This is a Smaller Subheading</h3>
    <h4>This is a Sub-Subheading</h4>
    <h5>This is a Minor Subheading</h5>
    <h6>This is the Smallest Heading</h6>
</body>

</html>

<p>This is visible text.</p>
